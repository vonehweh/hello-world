# Influencer Marketing
Most people live on social media, it’s a way to connect with friends and family and stay up to date on everything from politics to your favorite celebrities. 
## What is an Influencer? :bulb:
This term **“influencer”** means someone who is established in an industry, has a large following, and can sway their following in one direction or another. These fan bases allow for **influencers** to sell their own products, be sponsored by companies or create an ad from a post. Influencers can be anyone who has started from the *ground up*, or *traditional celebrities* with a distinct social media presence.
### Platforms for Influencers
* YouTube
* Instagram
* Twitter
* Any social media platform you can think of! 
### How to be a good Influencer on Instagram
1. A theme for your account
2. A filter to go with all of your photos
3. A good eye for photography
4. A following that trusts you
## What is Influencer Marketing? :bulb:
Now, knowing what an influencer is brings up the question, what does this matter to you? The answer is \*influencer marketing\*. Most people spend hours upon hours submerged in some sort of media in a day. Add in our phones, and everything is just that more accessible. I personally even struggle limiting my social media usage to 2 hours a day. There is just so much going on, and we love being connected. Not only with our friends, but the influencers we follow. We have made social media an integral part of our lives, and because of that we are immersed in the lives of the people we follow. 
Influencer marketing is, according to [TapInfluencer.com](https://www.tapinfluence.com/blog-what-is-influencer-marketing/) 
> a type of marketing that focuses on using key leaders to drive your brand’s message to the larger market.
>Rather than marketing directly to a large group of consumers, you instead inspire / hire / pay influencers to get out the word for you.

Basically, if you follow anyone that posts ads, or uses a sponsored product in a post, you are experiencing influencer marketing.
### What a good influencer marketing campaign does: 
- [x] Discloses sponsorships
- [ ] Does not use \#Ad
- [x] Reaches out to trustworthy influencers
- [ ] Choose influencer with bought followers
- [x] Chooses influencers with genuine content


Influencer Plattform | Disclosure
------------ | -------------
Instagram| \#Ad \#Sponsored
YouTube | Disclosure of sponsorship in first 30 seconds

So, when that instagram account that you follow, that portrays the perfect, well lit life you are dreaming of, posts a picture of the travel agency they love with a #ad, you can see influencer marketing at work!
